# Jquery Day Planner

The Jquery Day Planner allows the users to input their daily schedule, leave the site and come back to all of their information stored in their local storage. The text boxes change color based on the time of day to show past, present and future times and upcoming events. 

# Features

This page includes jquery functions that allow users to click buttons to save their events based on the time. It utilizes a hover function to ensure the user to see a change in the buttons they're selecting. It stores data in local storage to allow the user to leave the page and return to their information still populated. It changes color based on the time of day using a jquery function to compare the current time with the times found on the page.
